How to build
============

* Checkout this repo into device/meizu/mx4 in you Cyanogenmod 12 repo
* Get a flymeos 4.5 update image
* Decompress the image
* Rebuild the system.img using a converter such as http://nextgen4k.blogspot.ca/2015/02/lollipop-dat-files-decompress.html#.VfyoV5cVVZ4
* Mount the system.img somewhere
* Change the variable ```STOCK_DIR``` in extract_files.sh to reflect where you mounted the system.img
* Run extract-files.sh to populate vendor/meizu/mx4 with the proprietary files
* Go back to the root of your repository
* ```. ./build/envsetup.sh```
* ```lunch cm_mx4-userdebug```
* ```brunch mx4```
* Go for a walk this might be long
